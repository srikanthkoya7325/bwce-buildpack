Here are people who have contributed to Woodstox development:
(version numbers in brackets indicate release in which the problem was fixed)

Tatu Saloranta, tatu.saloranta@iki.fi: Author

Christian Niles:
  * Pointed out the improvement to wstx.jar, that will set system properties
    necessary to automatically make Woodstox the default StAX implementation
    to use
    [0.8.3]

James Fogarty:
  * Found 3 bugs (getElementText() not working, incorrect index offset
    for non-ns getAttributeLocalName(), index-out-of-bounds when there
    were lots of attribute names whose hashes collide)
    [1.0-RC1, 1.0-RC2]

James Strachan:
  * Found problems with stream writer; namespace repairing mode was not
    working as expected
    [1.0-RC5]

Stepan Koltsov:
  * Found problems with event reader: was setting peeked event to null, yet
    trying to de-reference it
    [1.0-RC7]

Mat Gessel:
  * Pointed out a problem with XMLStreamReader.nextTag() implementation;
    was not skipping comments and PIs
    [1.0-final]

Dan Diephouse:
  * Reported problems with QName construction (null prefix causes
    exception on some QName implementations)
    [1.0.1]
  * Reported [WSTX-9] (sr.getTextCharacters() problems)
    [2.0.3/2.7]

Sven Köhler:
  * Reported the problem with blocking input streams, and behaviour of
    the UTF8 decoder Woodstox uses: this could cause "too early" blocking
    of readers, in cases where event(s) could be returned before needing
    to read more from underlying input stream.
    [1.0.4 / 1.7]
  * Reported a bug in stream writer; a call to writeEmptyElement() followed
    by a call to writeEndElement() ignored latter call.
    [1.0.5 / 1.8.2]

Casey Bowman:
  * Pointed out the (potential) problem with javax.xml.stream.Location;
    return values are ints, and may thus overflow for BIG documents.
    StAX2 extensions (XMLStreamLocation2) added to properly deal with
    the problem.
    [1.8]

Stefan Wachter:
  * Reported a problem with handling of large documents; was sometimes
    throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception (mostly when dealing
    with gzipped streams).
    [1.0.3 / 1.8.1]

Eric Jain:
  * Reported a bug in default namespace handling; was reporting a bogus
    problem when declaring an explicit namespace before the default one
    on a start element
    [1.0.3 / 1.8.1]
  * Re-reported the problem with UTF-8 streams and array bounds (originally
    reported by Stefan Wachter), and provided unit test to reproduce it.
    [1.0.4 / 1.8.1]

Marius Raschip:
  * Reported a problem with handling of UTF-16 (and in general all non-UTF-8
    multi-byte encodings): wasn't handling xml declaration correctly.
    [1.0.5 / 1.8.2]

Olivier Potonniee:
  * Reported compilation problems (incorrect package name for one class,
    conflicting method name for LineSuppressWriter)
    [1.0.6 / 1.9]

Ron Yang:
  * Reported an intermittent problem caused by broken handling of SymbolTable
    sharing, and also pointed out a potential solution (had been fixed for
    2.0 branch earlier, but not for 1.0.x).
    [1.0.7]

Ulrich Callmeier:
  * Reported a bug with START_DOCUMENT handling of XMLStreamWriter
    implementation
    [1.0.7 / 2.0-final]
  * Reported a bug with the input factory: entity and dtd resolvers were
    not being properly passed to instances
    [1.0.7 / 2.0-final]
  * Report a bug with WriterBase, base class for all encoding writers
    (attribute, element text): an NPE was thrown when trying to output
    encoded characters.
    [2.0.1]
  * Reported a bug in DTD-handling; DTDs that had enumerated value "-"
    (or "--"), were throwing an exception.
    [2.0.1]

Peter Tauter:
  * Reported a bug with WriterBase; see the entry next to Ulrich for details.

Linus Ericson:
  * Reported bugs:
    * [WSTX-3]: WDTD.java was missing one double quote from output
      [2.0.2]
    * [WSTX-7] SimpleNsStreamWriter was stripping out attribute namespaces
      [2.0.3]

Patrick D'Cruze:
  * Reported bug [WSTX-8]; nextTag() followed by peek() at the start of a
    document did not work.
    [2.0.3]

Erik Smith:
  * Reported [WSTX-9] (sr.getTextCharacters() problems)
    [2.0.3]

Kevin Vargo:
  * Reported [WSTX-9] (sr.getTextCharacters() problems)
    [2.0.3]

Heinz Drews:
  * Reported [WSTX-10] (handling of 3-byte UTF-8 Byte Order Marker did
    not work properly when XMLStreamReader was constructed for a Reader)
    [2.0.3]
  * Reported [WSTX-19] (unnecessary default namespace declarations written
    in repairing mode)
    [2.0.4]

Wolfgang Hoschek:
  * Reported [WSTX-27] (incorrect handling of #FIXED attribute defaults)
    [2.0.4]

Bartlomiej Rymkowski:
  * Reported [WSTX-28] (broken handling of property
    (WstxInputProperties.P_CUSTOM_INTERNAL_ENTITIES)
    [2.0.5]

Arjen Poutsma:
  * Reported [WSTX-45] (WstxEventReader#peek() throwing EOF instead
    of returning null), pointed out fix.
    [2.0.6]

John Kristian:
  * Reported [WSTX-46] Trying to write another root element produced an
    incorrect error message
    [2.0.6]

Steve Yost:
  * Reported a problem with setting P_VALIDATE_STRUCTURE
    [2.0.6]
  * Reported a problem with stream writer when trying to output
    non-wellformed (multiple root elements) content even when
    structural well-formedness checks are disabled.
